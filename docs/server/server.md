# Server

The Piko server is responsible for forwarding traffic from downstream clients
to upstream listeners. See [How Piko Works](../how-piko-works.md) for details.

The server is designed to be hosted as a cluster of nodes behind a HTTP load
balancer.

Run a server node with `piko server`.

## Ports

The Piko server exposes 4 ports:
* Proxy port: Receives HTTP(S) requests from proxy clients which are routed to
an upstream service
* Upstream port: Accepts connections from upstream services
* Admin port: Exposes metrics and a status API to inspect the server state
* Gossip port: Used for inter-node gossip traffic

The proxy port and upstream port are kept separate to support different access
to each port. Such as if you're using Piko to access external customer
networks, the upstream port may be exposed to the Internet for upstreams to
connect, but you may only allow proxy requests from clients in the same network
as Piko. Similarly the admin port should not be exposed to the Internet.

The proxy, upstream and admin ports are all designed to be hosted behind a HTTP
load balancer. The upstream port uses WebSockets so you must ensure your load
balancer is configured correctly.

## Configuration

Piko server supports both YAML configuration and command-line flags.

The YAML file path can be set using `--config.path`.

See `piko server -h` for the available configuration options.

### Variable Substitution

When enabling `--config.expand-env`, Piko will expand environment variables
in the loaded YAML configuration. This will replace references to `${VAR}`
and `$VAR` with the corresponding environment variable.

If the environment variable is not defined, it will be replaced with an empty
string. You can also define a default value using form `${VAR:default}`.

### YAML Configuration

The server supports the following YAML configuration (where most parameters
have corresponding command line flags):

```
cluster:
  # A unique identifier for the node in the cluster.
  #
  # By default a random ID will be generated for the node.
  node_id: ""

  # A prefix for the node ID.
  #
  # Piko will generate a unique random identifier for the node and append it to
  # the given prefix.
  #
  # Such as you could use the node or pod  name as a prefix, then add a unique
  # identifier to ensure the node ID is unique across restarts.
  node_id_prefix: ""

  # A list of addresses of members in the cluster to join.
  #
  # This may be either addresses of specific nodes, such as
  # '--cluster.join 10.26.104.14,10.26.104.75', or a domain that resolves to
  # the addresses of the nodes in the cluster (e.g. a Kubernetes headless
  # service), such as '--cluster.join piko.prod-piko-ns'.
  #
  # Each address must include the host, and may optionally include a port. If no
  # port is given, the gossip port of this node is used.
  #
  # Note each node propagates membership information to the other known nodes,
  # so the initial set of configured members only needs to be a subset of nodes.

## Cluster

To deploy Piko as a cluster, configure `--cluster.join` to a list of cluster
members in the cluster to join.

The addresses may be either addresses of specific nodes, such as
`10.26.104.14`, or a domain name that resolves to the IP addresses of all nodes
in the cluster.

To deploy Piko to Kubernetes, you can create a headless service whose domain
resolves to the IP addresses of the pods in the service, such as
`piko.prod-piko-ns.svc.cluster.local`. When Piko starts, it will then attempt
to join the other pods in the cluster. See [Kubernetes](./kubernetes.md) for
details on hosting Piko on Kubernetes.

## Authentication

To authenticate Piko endpoints, Piko can use a
[JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) provided by your application.

Each port (proxy, upstream and admin) has separate authentication
configuration. You configure the port with the secret key or public key to
verify the JWT.

Piko supports HMAC, RSA, and ECDSA JWT algorithms, specifically HS256, HS384,
HS512, RSA256, RSA384, RSA512, EC256, EC384, and EC512.

The server has the following configuration options to pass a secret key or
public key:
- `auth.hmac_secret_key`: Add HMAC secret key
- `auth.rsa_public_key`: Add RSA public key
- `auth.ecdsa_public_key`: Add ECDSA public key

Such as to configure the 'upstream' port, you could configure
`upstream.auth.rsa_public_key`.

If no keys secret or public keys are given, Piko will allow unauthenticated
endpoint connections.

Piko will verify the `exp` (expiry) and `iat` (issued at) claims if given.

By default Piko will not verify the `aud` (audience) or `iss` (issuer) claims,
though you can enable these checks with `auth.audience` and
`auth.issuer` respectively.

You may also include Piko specific fields in your JWT. Piko supports the
`piko.endpoints` claim which contains an array of endpoint IDs the token is
permitted to access. Such as if the JWT includes claim
`"piko": {"endpoints": ["endpoint-123"]}`, it will be permitted to access
endpoint ID `endpoint-123` but not `endpoint-xyz`.

## Observability

Each server node has an admin port (`8003` by default) which includes
Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`, a health endpoint at `/health`, and a status
API at `/status`. The status API exposes endpoints for inspecting the status of
a server node, which is used by the `piko server status` CLI.

See [Observability](./observability.md) for details.
